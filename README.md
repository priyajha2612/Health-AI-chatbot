## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools and libraries to be set up on your development machine. 

- **Node.js**:  Download and install the latest stable version of Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  Node.js comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager), which we'll use to install other dependencies.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js. We'll install this using npm later in the setup process.
- **MongoDB Atlas**:  A cloud-based database service by MongoDB. You can sign up for a free tier account to use MongoDB Atlas for development purposes: [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

- **LM Studio**: A tool for running machine learning models locally. You can download LM Studio from their website: [Download LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) 

- **VS Code**: A powerful, lightweight code editor with great features for development. Download VS Code for your operating system here: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **Postman**: A collaboration platform for designing and testing APIs. You can download the free desktop app or use the web version: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) 

### Dependencies

* `mongodb`: This library allows our application to interact with the MongoDB database.
* `express`: This library provides a framework for building web applications in Node.js.
* `crypto`: This library provides cryptographic functions used for security purposes (e.g., password hashing).
* `cors`: This library enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) which allows requests from different domains.
* `multer`: This Node.js middleware enables the application to handle file uploads, which is required for profile photo upload for user profile.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

## üî® Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this project's repository from GitHub to your local machine. This command downloads all the project files to your computer.

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theeguyver/health-ai.git
cd health-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Before running the application, we need to install the required libraries and dependencies. These libraries provide the functionalities used in the project's code. We'll use `npm install` to install them.

```bash
npm install mongodb express crypto cors multer
```

### 3. Start the Servers

This project consists of multiple servers running on different ports. Each server handles a specific functionality of the application. Here's how to start each server:

**a. ML Server (Port 1234)**

This server handles communication with the machine learning model (used for tasks like text analysis or generation). We won't directly start this server with a node command. We will set up the ML Server later in **Step 4**. 

**b. Chat Response Server (Port 2000)**

Navigate to the directory containing the chat response server code (`app/chatbot`) and run `node chatresponse.js` to start the server. This server processes chatbot interactions.

```bash
cd app/chatbot
node chatresponse.js
```

**c. Database Server (Port 3000)**

Run `node backend.js` to start the server. This server interacts with the MongoDB database.

```bash
node backend.js
```

**d. Frontend Server (Port 3001)**

Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend application. This is the user interface you'll interact with in the browser.

```bash
npm run dev
```

**e. Fetch User Details Server (Port 3002)**

Navigate to the directory containing the user details fetching code (`app/user`) and run `node fetchuserdetails.js` to start the server. This server retrieves user data.

```bash
cd app/user
node fetchuserdetails.js
```

**f. Therapists Fetch Details Server (Port 3003)**

Navigate to the directory containing the therapist details fetching code (`app/library`) and run `node therapistsfetchdetails.js` to start the server. This server retrieves therapist data.

```bash
cd app/library
node therapistsfetchdetails.js
```

**g. Profile Photo Upload Server (Port 3004)**

Navigate to the directory containing the profile photo upload code (`app/user`) and run `node profilephotoupload.js` to start the server. This server handles profile picture uploads.

```bash
cd app/user
node profilephotoupload.js
```

**h. Chat History Server (Port 4002)**

Navigate to the directory containing the chat history code (`app/chatbot`) and run `node chathistory.js` to start the server. This server manages chat history.

```bash
cd app/chatbot
node chathistory.js
```

### 4. Set up Local ML Server

This project utilizes a machine learning model. Here's how to set up a local server to run the model:

* **Download the Model:** Visit [Carl-Llama-2-13B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Carl-Llama-2-13B-GGUF) on Hugging Face to download the machine learning model.
* **Load the model into LM Studio:**  Follow LM Studio's instructions to load the downloaded model.
* **Start the server:**  Use LM Studio's interface to start the server that will run the model.

### 5. Open the project. 
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production build of the app.

### Additional Notes

* Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine before proceeding. Node.js is the runtime environment that allows our JavaScript code to run. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Postman** is a helpful tool for testing the application's API endpoints during development.

## üßë‚ÄçüíªDevelopment

This section provides instructions for running the project in development mode and some guidelines for contributing to the codebase.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Refer to the Prerequisites section for installation instructions.  

### Database Connection

This project utilizes a MongoDB database to store application data. You'll need to connect your local development environment to your MongoDB instance. Replace `'YOUR_MONGODB_URI'` with your own MongoDB connection URI in the following files:

* Line 9 of `backend.js`
* Line 6 of `app/chatbot/chathistory.js`
* Line 9 of `app/library/therapistfetchdetails.js`
* Line 11 of `app/user/fetchuserdetails.js`
* Line 11 of `app/user/profilephotoupload.js`

Instructions for obtaining your MongoDB connection URI can be found in your MongoDB provider's documentation.

### Google Maps API Key

The Google Maps integration within the therapist details page utilizes an API key. To enable this functionality, you'll need to generate a Google Maps API Key and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual key in line 46 of `page.tsx` located under `app/library`.

### Ports
